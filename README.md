# Review Sentiment Classifier

This repository contains a sentiment analysis pipeline for customer reviews using multiple vectorization techniques and classification models. Developed as part of a data mining final project.

## 🎯 Goal
To classify customer reviews into positive or negative sentiment with high accuracy and robustness.

## 🧪 Workflow
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Lowercasing
   - Stop word removal
   - Punctuation cleaning

2. **Vectorization**:
   - TF-IDF
   - Word2Vec
   - BERT embeddings

3. **Modeling**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - K-Nearest Neighbors

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Grid search with F1 score optimization
   - Ensuring F1 > 0.8 for all models

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Gensim
- SentenceTransformers

## 📊 Evaluation
Models are compared based on precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure robustness against class imbalance.

## 📌 Notes
- No AI-generated code allowed per course policy
- Students must present and explain their implementation
